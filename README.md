# Hosting

app.py is a super small flask app that listens for post request on /submit and saves essential as essential_\<discordname\>.exefs in the essentials folder. To manage the essentials remotely, use the admin panel accessible under /admin. Username/password are set in config.ini.

### Setup

1. Fill out config.ini.example and rename it to config.ini
2. Install gunicorn, flask and flask_httpauth via pip:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install flask gunicorn flask_httpauth
```
To run the flask app, activate the venv and run:
```bash
gunicorn -w 1 app:app
```
